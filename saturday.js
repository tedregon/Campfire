Verse:
D           C           G           D

        title: "Hotel California",
        artist: "Eagles",
        key: "Am",
        chords: `Capo 1st fret

Verse:
Am           E           G           D
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Am           E           G           D
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Am           E           G           D
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Am           E           G           D
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night

Chorus:
F           C           D           E
Welcome to the Hotel California, such a lovely place
F           C           D           E
Such a lovely face, plenty of room at the Hotel California`,
        lyrics: `On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night

Welcome to the Hotel California, such a lovely place
Such a lovely face, plenty of room at the Hotel California`
