        title: "Landslide",
        artist: "Fleetwood Mac",
        key: "C",
        chords: `Capo 3rd fret

Verse:
C           G           Am          F
I took my love, I took it down, I climbed a mountain and I turned around
C           G           Am          F
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
C           G           Am          F
'Til the landslide brought me down

Chorus:
F           C           G           Am
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
F           C           G           Am
Can the child within my heart rise above?
F           C           G           Am
Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?
F           C           G           Am
Can I handle the seasons of my life?`,
        lyrics: `I took my love, I took it down, I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
'Til the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?`

        title: "The Sound of Silence",
        artist: "Simon & Garfunkel",
        key: "Em",
        chords: `Capo 2nd fret

Verse:
Em           C           G           D
Hello darkness, my old friend, I've come to talk with you again
Em           C           G           D
Because a vision softly creeping left its seeds while I was sleeping
Em           C           G           D
And the vision that was planted in my brain still remains
Em           C           G           D
Within the sound of silence

Chorus:
C           G           D           Em
In restless dreams I walked alone, narrow streets of cobblestone
C           G           D           Em
'Neath the halo of a street lamp, I turned my collar to the cold and damp`,
        lyrics: `Hello darkness, my old friend, I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone, narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp, I turned my collar to the cold and damp`
