        title: "Wagon Wheel",
        artist: "Old Crow Medicine Show",
        key: "G",
        chords: `Capo 2nd fret

Verse:
G           D           Em          C
Headed down south to the land of the pines
G           D           Em          C
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
G           D           Em          C
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
G           D           Em          C
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
G           D           Em          C
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
G           D           Em          C
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

Chorus:
C           G           D           Em
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
C           G           D           Em
Rock me mama anyway you feel
C           G           D           Em
Hey mama rock me`,
        lyrics: `Headed down south to the land of the pines

Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama anyway you feel
Hey mama rock me`
