        title: "Wonderwall",
        artist: "Oasis",
        key: "C",
        chords: `Capo 2nd fret

Verse:
C           G           Am          F
Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
C           G           Am          F
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
C           G           Am          F
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

Chorus:
F           C           G           Am
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
F           C           G           Am
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
F           C           G           Am
There are many things that I would like to say to you but I don't know how`,
        lyrics: `Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you but I don't know how

Because maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all, you're my wonderwall`

Verse:
D           A           Bm          G
Hey there Delilah, what's it like in New York City?
D           A           Bm          G
I'm a thousand miles away but girl tonight you look so pretty
D           A           Bm          G

I swear it's true

I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen
G           D           A           Bm
Close your eyes, listen to my voice it's my disguise

I'm by your side`,

Hey there Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen
Close your eyes, listen to my voice it's my disguise

        title: "Hallelujah",
        artist: "Jeff Buckley",
        key: "C",
        chords: `Capo 1st fret

Verse:
C           Am          F           G
I heard there was a secret chord that David played and it pleased the Lord
C           Am          F           G
But you don't really care for music, do you?
C           Am          F           G
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth, the minor fall, the major lift
C           Am          F           G
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Chorus:
F           C           G           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah`,
        lyrics: `I heard there was a secret chord that David played and it pleased the Lord

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah`
